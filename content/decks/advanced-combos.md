# Advanced Combo Strategies

Master the art of combining cards to create devastating effects and dominate competitive play.

## Understanding Card Synergy

Card synergy occurs when two or more cards work together to create an effect greater than the sum of their parts. Learning to identify and exploit these synergies is key to becoming a top-tier player.

## Popular Combo Archetypes

### Energy Acceleration + Big Attackers

Combine cards that accelerate energy attachment with Pokemon that have high energy costs but devastating attacks. This allows you to power up threats faster than your opponent can respond.

### Draw Engine + Lock Cards

Build a deck that can consistently draw cards while disrupting your opponent's ability to do the same. Control the pace of the game and dictate the tempo.

### Evolution Chains + Stage Support

Maximize the potential of evolution Pokemon by including cards that make evolution easier and protect your evolving Pokemon.

## Building Around Combos

When building a combo-focused deck, consider:

1. **Consistency** - Can you reliably assemble your combo pieces?
2. **Speed** - How quickly can you execute your combo?
3. **Disruption resistance** - What happens if your opponent disrupts one piece?
4. **Backup plans** - Do you have alternative win conditions?

## Practice and Refinement

Test your combos extensively to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Adjust your deck based on the meta and your local competition.
