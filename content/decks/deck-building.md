# Core Principles

Building a competitive deck requires understanding the meta, card synergies, and proper resource management.

## Deck Ratios

Optimal deck composition:

- **12-16 Pokemon cards** with clear evolution lines
- **30-35 Trainer cards** including draw support and search cards
- **10-15 Energy cards** based on your deck's energy requirements

## Consistency is Key

Include 4 copies of your essential cards. Use search cards like Ultra Ball and evolution support like Rare Candy to ensure you can execute your strategy consistently.

## Card Selection Guidelines

### Pokemon Line

- Choose a clear win condition (your main attacker)
- Include support Pokemon that complement your strategy
- Consider tech Pokemon to counter popular decks

### Trainer Cards

- **Draw Support**: Professor's Research, Boss's Orders
- **Search Cards**: Ultra Ball, Nest Ball, Evolution Incense
- **Utility**: Switch, Energy Retrieval, Tool cards

### Energy Distribution

Calculate your average attack costs and ensure you can power up consistently. Consider special energy cards that provide additional benefits.

## Testing and Refinement

Build your deck, playtest it extensively, and adjust based on:
- Which cards are most/least useful
- Speed of setup
- Consistency of your win condition
- Performance against popular meta decks
