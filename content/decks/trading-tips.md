## Price Research

Check multiple sources:
- TCGPlayer market prices
- eBay sold listings (not active listings)

Join local Pokemon TCG communities and attend regular events. Building a network of traders helps you find cards you need and moves cards you don't.

### Where to Trade

- **Local game stores** - Weekly events and casual play
- **League nights** - Regular gatherings of players
- **Tournaments** - Larger events with more traders
- **Online communities** - Discord servers and Reddit

## Trading Strategies

Maximize your trades:
