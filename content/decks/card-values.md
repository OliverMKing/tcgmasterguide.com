# Factors Affecting Value

Card values are determined by multiple factors including rarity, condition, competitive viability, and collector demand.

## Rarity Tiers

Pokemon TCG cards come in various rarities:

- **Common/Uncommon** - Base cards, typically low value
- **Rare** - Standard rare pulls
- **Holo Rare** - Foil version of rare cards
- **Ultra Rare** - Special full art or textured cards
- **Secret Rare** - Cards beyond the set number

## Grading and Condition

Cards in mint condition are worth significantly more than played copies. Professional grading services like PSA and CGC provide authentication and condition assessment.

### Condition Scale

- **Gem Mint (10)** - Perfect condition
- **Mint (9)** - Near perfect with minor imperfections
- **Near Mint (8)** - Light wear
- **Excellent (7)** - Visible wear but no major damage
- **Below** - Played condition, significantly reduced value

## Market Trends

Key value indicators:

- **Tournament performance** driving competitive card prices
- **Nostalgic sets** maintaining long-term collector value
- **New set releases** affecting singles market prices
- **Popular Pokemon** typically worth more
- **Limited edition promos** often highly valuable
